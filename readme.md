32. Create a class Box with instance variables length, width, and height. Include a method volume to compute
the volume of the box. Create another class BoxDemo with the main function that creates an object of class Box
named mybox1 and set the values for instance variables(length, width, and height). Invoke the function volume
in Box to compute the volume of the created object mybox1.
33. Write a Java program to implement Stack using arrays.
34. Design a class to represent a bank account. Include the following members:
Data Members:
Name of the depositor
Account Number
Type of Account
Balance amount in the account
Methods :
To deposit an amount
To withdraw an amount after checking the balance
To display the name and balance
Incorporate default and parameterized constructor to provide initial values
35. Write a Java program that creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name, Age,
Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'printSalary( )' which prints the salary of
the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherit the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and
'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign a name, age,
phone number, address, and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and
print the same.
36. Write two Java classes, Employee and Engineer. The engineer should inherit from Employee class.
Employee class to have two methods display() and calcSalary(). Write a program to display the engineer salary
and to display from Employee class using a single object instantiation (i.e., only one object creation is allowed).
    - display() only prints the name of the class and does not return any value. Ex. “ Name of class is Employee.”
    - calcSalary() in Employee displays “Salary of employee is 10000” and calcSalary() in Engineer displays“Salary of
employee is 20000.”
37. Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named
numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle, and Hexagon such that each one of the
classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows
the number of sides in the given geometrical structures.
38. Create a package ‘studpack’ which incorporates Student class and Sports interface. Create a Result class that
extends Student class and implements a sports interface to display the total marks. The details of the classes and
interfaces described below. Use appropriate access specifier as per the requirement. (*method, -variable) Create
a java program Hybrid.java that imports Result class from studpack and display the total for 5 students.
39. Write a Java program that shows the usage of try, catch, and finally
40. Write a Java program to find the factorial of a number using BufferedReader Class
41. Write a Java program to copy the contents of one file to another file using FileReader/FileWriter Class.
42. Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the
integers (Use StringTokenizer class of java.util)
43. Write a Java program to copy the contents of one file to another file using FileInputStream and
FileOutputStream classes.
44. Create a Java package named ‘NewPackage’ which consist of a class called ‘NewClass’. ‘NewClass’ hava a
method ‘parityCheck’ which check whether a given number is odd or even and return a string as a result. Import
this package in another class and call the method ‘parityCheck’.

interface)
47. Write a java program to implement ArrayList using Collections Framework
48. Write a java program that creates multiple child threads to print odd and even numbers.(extending
Thread class)
49. Write a Java program that implements a multi-threaded program which has three threads. First thread
generates a random integer every 1 second. If the value is even, second thread computes the square of the
number and prints. If the value is odd the third thread will print the value of cube of the number. (implements
Runnable Interface and Random Class)
50. Write a Java program for the following: i) Create a doubly linked list of elements. ii) Delete a given
element from the above list. iii) Display the contents of the list after deletion.(using Colections Framework-
LinkedList Interface)
